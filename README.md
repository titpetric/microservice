# microservice

DevOPS/Docker/Go Advent of Code 2019

Initially the articles and code here is published as a series on [scene-si.org](https://scene-si.org).

- [x] Go: Introduction to Protobuf: Messages
- [x] Go: Introduction to protobufs RPC
- [x] Make: dynamic makefile targets
- [x] Bash: poor mans code generation
- [x] Bash: embedding files into Go
- [x] Go: listing database migrations
- [x] Drone CI: testing database migrations

Currently this adds up to 7/24 articles.

These are some tentative article titles for future articles:

- [ ] Go: Database first struct generation,
- [ ] Go: Writing our own human readable key/value decoder,
- [ ] Go: decoding data into structs with tags,
- [ ] Go: Generating documentation from database schema,
- [ ] Drone CI: secrets and docker image building,
- [ ] Docker service security,
- [ ] Elastic APC: Instrumenting your RPC,
- [ ] Elastic APC: Instrumenting your SQL,
- [ ] Elastic APC: Instrumenting the HTTP client,
- [ ] Docker: compose service gateway (self hosted) (jwilder/nginx-proxy or traefik?)
- [ ] Running a docker swarm microservice,
- [ ] Difference between docker compose and stack deploy

The order of the articles (until they are written) is undefined. The complete guide
is a step by step process where knowledge and the results from previous steps are
required to continue forward. It's meant to guide the developer from next to zero
code, all up until the point where all the code for the microservice is written.
